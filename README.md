To-do
Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) from your previous CSC300 class in C++.
Task 1: Include the basic operations insert, delete (handle all three cases), and search.
Task 2: Include additional operations for traversal (inorder, preorder, and post order), check if tree is Balanced, and find the height of a given node.
Task 3: Use header files to organize your code.
-
Use three files bst.h, bst.cpp, and mainbst.cpp
Task 4: Use the provided exception handling to manage invalid operations
-
Ensure that you are handling edge cases like searching for an empty tree, inserting duplicate values, â€¦
Task 5: Use make files to automate compiling and running your program (use version 5)
